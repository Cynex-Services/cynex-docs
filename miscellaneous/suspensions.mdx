## Suspension Policy

Suspensions are essential for maintaining the safety and standards of our community. This guide explains why suspensions occur, how to appeal them, and answers common questions about the process.

## Reasons for Suspension
Suspensions are issued to address significant issues impacting our community. Common reasons include:

- **Misuse of Services:** Violating community standards by misusing our platform.
- **Age Restrictions:** Accessing our platform without meeting the minimum age requirement.
- **Identity Misrepresentation:** Impersonating others or misrepresenting your identity.
- **False Information:** Spreading misleading or incorrect information about our platform or its users.

## How to Appeal a Suspension
If you believe your suspension was issued incorrectly or unfairly, you can appeal it by creating a support ticket. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Create a Ticket:** Open a support ticket in our server with the following details:
   - Your Discord Username and Account ID.
   - A clear explanation of why you think the suspension was a mistake.
   - Any relevant evidence you may have.

2. **Review Process:** Our support team will review your ticket. Responses might take some time, so please be patient.

3. **Decision:** You will receive a notification about the outcome of your appeal through the support ticket. If your appeal is successful, the suspension will be lifted. If not, the suspension will remain in effect.

   > **Note:** Appeals are evaluated based on the information provided and not on assurances of future behavior.

## Refunds and Financial Matters
Refunds are generally not provided for suspensions. By using our services, you agreed to our Terms of Service, which include the possibility of suspension. Refunds due to suspension are typically not granted.

## Suspension Duration
The duration of suspensions can vary. Most are permanent, but some may be temporary based on the nature of the violation and individual circumstances.

## Reporting Issues
To report a user for violating our terms, please create a support ticket in our server. We handle policy-related issues and service integrity concerns through our ticketing system.
